1) a = false -> ~a  = -1 but how to get 1 here like negation of 0 is 1 but we are getting -1, do hit and trial and try to know whether we can get ~0 as 1 or not.
2) Why can't we confidently say that in right shift operator , we can not say that it is always divide by 2? and why can we say that in left shift it is always multiply by 2
3) int a = 5; why is the output of (++a) * (++a) = 49. Use the concept of precedence in this
4) Search what can be given inside the expression of switch i.e. float,string,statement,character,number? Explore them
5) Can we use continue inside switch instead of continue?
6) Using global variable is a bad practice. Why?
