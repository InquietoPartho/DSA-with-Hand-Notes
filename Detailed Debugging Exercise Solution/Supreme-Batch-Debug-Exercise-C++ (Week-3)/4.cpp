// The meaning of the question is that we have to print those elements which are occuring more than once in the array and that too only one time.
// So here the condition was freq[arr[i]] > 1 so it will print for frequency 2,3, and so on. So we modified the condition to freq[arr[i]] == 2 so that it prints only for 2.
