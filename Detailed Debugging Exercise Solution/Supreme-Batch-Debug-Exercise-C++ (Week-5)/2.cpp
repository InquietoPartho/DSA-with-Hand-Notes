// While finding the maximum value, we need to compare with the minimum value and we took here INT_MIN
// Consdier the example of string ssaa, here if we use max<=count[str[i]] then a would be the answer but we were suppossed to find the first maximum occuring character and hence we need to use < symbol only.
