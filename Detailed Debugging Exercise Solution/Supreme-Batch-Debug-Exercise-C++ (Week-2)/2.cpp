// First of all in Line-14, we have not declared j and we are using it so corrected it to int j = 1 (Corrected line-14)
// As we can see that we need to print the palindrome and hence we need to start from 2*i-1 rather than i-1(Corrected line-14)
// Also in the if condition it was if(1 || j<=k), In this j<=k is not checked at all as OR with 1 always give true and hence removed 1 || and changed the if condition to if(j<=k) --> Corrected line-15
