// In Line-9 we have mentioned int size = N, but there was no N declared and initialized before it, so I have initialized int N = 5; (Added Line - 8)
// In Line-13, in the for loop it should go till <=i rather than just <i. (Corrected line - 13)
// In Line-14, 2 stars were getting printed at a time but we just have to print a single star (Corrected line -14)
