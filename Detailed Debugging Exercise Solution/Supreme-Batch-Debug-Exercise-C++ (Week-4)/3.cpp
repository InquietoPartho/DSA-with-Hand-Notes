// Selection sort is based on the idea that to put the minimum element for that particular pass to its right place.
// The logic for calculating the index of minimum element was right but then placing it at the right place was wrong.
// So simply put swap(arr[i],arr[minIndex]) instead of swap(arr[j],arr[minIndex]) as i was taken to be the initial element and that need to be swapped with the minimum element.
