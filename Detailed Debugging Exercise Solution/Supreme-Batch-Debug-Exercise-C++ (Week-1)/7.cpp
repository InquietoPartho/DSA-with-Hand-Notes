// Error - 1 -> The first inner for loop of spaces will run from j = 1 to n-i because ith row has n - i spaces. For example 1st row has n-1 spaces, 2nd row has n-2 spaces and so on (Corrected line-10)
// Error - 2 -> The left pyramid will be running till 2*i - 1 as we can see that the 1st row runs till 2x1 - 1 = 2-1 = 1, 2nd row runs till 2x2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 and so on (Corrected line - 14)
// Error - 3 -> First important observation is that the right pyramid will start from even number so 2 will be multiplied and it will start from 2*(i-1). Like 1st row will have no right pyramid as 2x(1-1) = 0. 2nd row 2x(2-1) = 2 (start from 2), 3rd row 2x(3-1) = 2x(2) = 4. (Corrected line - 17)
