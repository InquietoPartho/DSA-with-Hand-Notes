1) Check the stable and unstable sorting algorithm defintion. What type is bubble, selection sort and insertion sort?
2) Make a table of Time complexity and Space complexity of Normal case, Best Case and Worst case of Bubble,selection and insertion sort.
3) Sort array using sort inbuilt function
4) Which algorithm is used to implement inbuilt sort function
