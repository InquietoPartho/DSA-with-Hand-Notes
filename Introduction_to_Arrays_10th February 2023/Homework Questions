1) Find out what is the use of memset function.
2) int arr[10] = {0}; -> All the values are initialized to 0
   int arr[10] = {1}; -> All values won't be initialized to 1. Find using memset how to initialize with 1 or any particular value other than 0.
3) Implement swap function on your own way. (3 ways) --> Find all.
